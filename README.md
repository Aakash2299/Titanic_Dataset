# Titanic_Dataset
Design a regression model to predict some output on basis of input







 Titanic Dataset -
 
 
 
Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact)
and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.
The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for
each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.
Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers
on board (found in test.csv) survived.
